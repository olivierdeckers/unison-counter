# Unison counter ability

Contains the `Counter t` ability to count stuff. Add to your Unison codebase by running:

```pull git@github.com:olivierdeckers/unison-counter:.trunk .base.Counter```

Then define a sum type to differentiate different counters (if you want to count multiple things):
```unique type CounterType = Type1 | Type2```
